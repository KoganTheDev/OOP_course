## 📖 Overview

The **Task Dependency Manager** is a Java-based application designed to effectively manage tasks with dependencies. It allows users to represent a set of tasks, define dependencies between them, and determine the optimal order of execution. The project features two main classes: `Tasks` and `NamedTasks`, facilitating management via numerical indices and string names.

## ✨ Features

- **Task Management**: Create and manage tasks with dependencies.
- **Dependency Resolution**: Determine the execution order based on dependencies.
- **Named Tasks**: Use string names for easier task identification.
- **Circular Dependency Handling**: Gracefully manages circular dependencies.
