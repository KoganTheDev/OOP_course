# OOP_Course

Welcome to my **OOP_Course** repository! This repository showcases my journey through the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. Here, youâ€™ll find various projects that illustrate key OOP concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository serves as a collection of Java projects developed during my exploration of OOP principles. Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of OOP, providing practical examples of how to implement these concepts effectively.

Feel free to explore each project for detailed code and explanations!

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

Throughout this course, I've learned and applied the following OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class).
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.
